# Smash Bros. Ultimate Tournament
This project was inspired by a smash bros. tournament I held at my house between my friends and I. We all got confused on what the rules were and locating people to come sit in their chairs to play proved to be a challenge. I made this application to help any tournament operators, big or small. 

## Stage Striking
Out of the many, many stages in the game, only some are allowed in official tournament. The stage striking portion of this app allows players to choose out of the legal stages which they will play for that match.

## Registratioin
This application has basic guest and admin authentication. Users are automatically registered as guests, but if someone wants to be a tournament operator they may email me to get admin privileges. The reason I only allowed myself to be admin is because I used Twilio and did not want my account to be spammed with texts.

## Admin Privileges
Admins can text players using twilio and delete players. All players can update only themselves, but admins can make changes to all players.
